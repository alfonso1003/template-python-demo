Overview
========

The official command-line client for `The Coverage
Space <http://coverage.space>`__.

Setup
=====

Requirements
------------

-  Python 2.7+ or Python 3.3+

Installation
------------

The client can be installed with pip:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install --upgrade coverage.space

or directly from the source code:

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/jacebrowning/coverage-space-cli.git
    $ cd coverage-space-cli
    $ python setup.py install

Usage
=====

To update the value for a test coverage metric:

.. code:: sh

    $ coverage.space <owner/repo> <metric>

For example, after testing with code coverage enabled:

.. code:: sh

    $ coverage.space owner/repo unit

will attempt to extract the current coverage data from your working tree
and compare that with the last known value. The coverage value can also
be manually specified:

.. code:: sh

    $ coverage.space <owner/repo> <metric> <value>
